<p style="text-align: center;"><span>The great news that there is! Many essential oils provide excellent muscle and tendon pain relief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Irrespective of the how or when your injury occurred, it leaves you in an anything but ideal reality: unrelenting, irritating, and downright selfish pain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Your reaction probably goes like this:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: center;">
<li style="text-align: left;"><span>curse your pain</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span>avoid things that hurt</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span>try ice and heat</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span>pop pain pills.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Unfortunately, these treatments are often ineffective, barely making a dent in the source of your pain, and their ineffectiveness further compounds your irritation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Often your health care provider is just as frustrated as you are, since they recognize that are unable to give you an effective solution.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>While it&rsquo;s easily recognized, pain is actually a very complex process that involves emotion, genetics, biology, physiology and anatomy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>This complexity often makes a straightforward solution elusive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>But maybe there is a more ancient and natural remedy that could be more effective and safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>The fantastic news is that potentially there is: the venerable essential oil! There are 8 that are &mdash; well, essential &mdash; for muscle and tendon pain relief along with some of amazing blends.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Essential oils an ancient pain reliever</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Ancient healers used essential oils for thousands of years&nbsp; to promote health and treat a diverse variety of conditions .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>In fact, the ancient Chinese wrote an entire medical textbook called the &ldquo;Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor&rdquo; over 2500 year ago that highlighted the critical role essential oils played in treating illness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>Additionally, both the old and new testament emphasize the therapeutic benefit of essential oils. Remember the story of the three wise men?</span></p>
